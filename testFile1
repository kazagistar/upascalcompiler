for each test case type, we should have an edge case (on each edge), and 1-3 normal cases. test the errors as well
-also, we need to figure out what SHOULD be output if all is working well (after we have the cases written but before we run test)

//string test cases

//number test cases (int, fixed, float w/ all the fixings / variations (1 of each))

//comment test cases

//identifier test cases (including at least one case for each of the reserved words)

//symbol test cases (cases for each symbol)
